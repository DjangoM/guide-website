          { "text": "The Ethereum project aims to do for human collaboration what the internet did for information. It is part of a world computer, where everyone can publish and access content, write and use applications, send value and make agreements. This is done through so called smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps), open, tamper proof, opt-in, self executing applications that run exactly as programmed and all share one common, append-only 'truth', the Ethereum blockchain, while ensuring that there is no downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference." },
          { "text": "This decentralized environment allows all people, programs, IoT devices, markets, registries and other things to collaborate without the need for explicit trust. That's why people also call it the trust machine, it is not just an upgrade to our databases or internet, but rather a tool to re-architect social, financial and political systems. The Vision is one where people are no longer the product, producer and property of content platforms but are instead the contributors, curators and communicators of value." },
          { "text": "While that all just sounds a lot of awesome buzzwords, it is very actively developed by tens of thousand of developers around the world and happening right now. Below you'll find many links to videos, tutorials and instruction guides which will help you to get started. Welcome to the future." }

        { "question": "Can ether be used as a currency?", "answer": "Bitcoin tried to create the perfect 'coin', with a lot of focus  itself (how much are there, what is the increase schedule, etc...). It tries to compete with the Dollar, the Euro, the Yuan, gold, etc to buy things and thus make it valuable. Ethereum's focus is, rather on the monetary properties, on creating a whole ecosystem that has never existed before. Why use it for things you can buy with Dollars, Euro or Yuan? It is too volatile for merchants and service provider with bills to pay. A better solution would are be stable coins which track the value of one or more fiat currencies and will probably end up being the primary payment mechanism on Ethereum. Ether's function is more seen as investment in the network itself (used for all transactions, generating a return though staking, very low inflation), as technical payments between devices or as collateral deposits.", "links": [{"link": "https://ethereum.network/?q=stable coin", "title": "stable coins" }]},
